# Access OASIS

Here we explain briefly how you can access OASIS datasets. Any form of disclosure is prohibited and therefore, I'm not going to publish any links to the data I've prepared.

## Raw Data

To access the raw data, you would have to apply for it through their [website](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/access/). It shouldn't be that long before you're granted the access.
